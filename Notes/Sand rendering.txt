The sand storage should be modified so that only changed rows are redrawn. This will be a failry simple change, as with crafty enough class creation and overloading, staticSand[][] should still work.

It should become an array of sandPiles, which are themselves arrays of colours with an updated flag, reset every render call. When any pixel in the column has been modified (perhaps a custom setter), the entire column is redrawn to an image that is stored in the sandSystem class. This image is converted to a sprite and drawn at every frame, with the modified columns being redrawn immediately beforehand. The active sand would be drawn as it already is.
